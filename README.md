### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Since you're here, let me share some information about myself!

I started my professional career through Drexel's 5-year Co-op program which allowed me to discover my love for health and fitness from all angles. I already knew I had a large interest in overall health, as I am a lover of psychology and have been athletic all my life, especially once I started creating fitness programs for myself and occasionally for friends. What I didn't fully realize before a year ago was my love for the data side of business. As a previous fitness trainer and gym manager, data was essential to the effectiveness of a workout program or class and the health of the company, team, and gym itself. It's all over the place and I wanted to learn to do more with this data!

Management and training brought on another sort of fatigue I hadn't previously experienced either: social fatigue. Having to put on a smile 24/7 and be _the_ face of the gym got to me and my mental health over time and I realized my love for back-office work, if you will. Being able to escape to the computer was often a goal of mine towards the end of my time in management, and so I decided to make a change.

I'm now learning all about data through a Business Intelligence Analyst program at TripleTen. I have improved upon and gained skills in:
- Data visualization
- SQL
- Tableau
- Google Suite
- Microsoft Office
- Data analysis
- Storytelling with data
and more soft and hard skills related to personal and team management. I'm excited to combine my skills from my previous positions with my skills in data to help grow the company I end up at. Check out the projects I have done through TripleTen and other means!


Professional areas of interest as well as general interests and experience in:
- Art: watercolor painting, acrylic painting, pyrography/wood burning, charcoal drawing, music (consumption and singing)
- Travel: scheduling, planning, actually traveling, experiencing as many foods, landmarks, and cultures around the world as I can in this life of mine
- Everything nature: I'm just obsessed. I hike, kayak, climb, bike, swim, love the beach, and often show more interest in visiting natural landmarks than man-made ones when traveling. I also care deeply for our earth and have always wanted to work professionally in any area related to the natural world
- Gaming: video games, board games, brain games, action-adventure
- Animals: I am currently self-employed as a pet sitter and walker, I adore animals overall
- UGC and Promotion: interest but minimal experience as of right now
- Financial Planning: I like math, and I like to use it to help myself and others better manage their finances
- Psychology and therapy: I'm a massive advocate for therapy and have studied/researched psychology more than anything else besides fitness
- Hospitality: this is particularly related to cleaning and overall customer care since I've worked as a front desk employee, waitress, and restaurant manager (floor), and have had to clean areas from gyms to apartments
